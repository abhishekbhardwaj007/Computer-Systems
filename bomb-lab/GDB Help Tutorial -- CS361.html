<h2>GDB Tutorial</h2>
<h3>Scope</h3>

This tutorial is meant for very simple commands and functionality in
gdb.  This is meant just to get the users feet on the ground with GDB,
by no means does it give extremely powerful and complex commands.  It
basically just shows how to traverse a program in gdb, how to compile
to use gdb, how to analyze core files, and how to determine program
flow.

<p>
</p><h3>Conventions</h3>

The following will show you text conventions that should be followed
for this tutorial.

<pre>Text that will be outputted by gdb will appear like this</pre>

<pre><font color="red">Text that needs to typed in by the user will appear in red</font></pre>

Author Comments will appear normally like this, or <pre><font color="green">green like this</font></pre>

<br> 

You can find sample code here, it contains a binary called 'hello'.
There are tree files associated to this binary, hello.cc which is
where main is located, and word.cc/h this is a c++ style class.  This
example code will be used throughout this tutorial.

<p>
</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>C/C++ knowledge (you need to be able to code to have something to gdb..)
  </li><li>Comfort with the command line
  </li><li>Grab the <a href="http://oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu/~bhumphre/hello/">hello code</a>, and run make on it.
      This will work on the prime system, and most other systems.
      Make sure you grab all four files in this directory.
      This code is also available directly on prime in the course's
      code-egs directory.
</li></ul>
<p>

</p><h3>GDB Background</h3>
GDB stands for GNU Debugger

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

GDB can accomplish four different kinds of goals, start your program:
Specifying anything that might affect its behavior.  Make your program
stop on specified conditions.  Examine what has happened, when your
program has stopped.  Finally, change things in your program, so you
can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to
learn about another.  This tutorial will cover the first three things,
the fouth is out of the scope of this tutorial.
<p>

To get started with GDB we need to understand how it works.  GDB first
looks at the binary exectuable that must be made, it also looks at the
source files associated with that exectuable.  It then walks through
your program executing it as if you were running it from the command
line.  To start GDB we first need to look at how we compile.  To let
GDB be able to read all that information line by line, we need to
compile it a bit differently.  Normally we compile things
as:</p><pre><font color="red">gcc hello.cc</font></pre> Instead of doing
this, we need to compile with the -g flag as such: <pre><font color="red">gcc -g hello.cc</font></pre> Now we can invoke gdb with the
new a.out binary.  To invoke gdb we would do the following at the
command line.  If you use the makefile in the hello directory, it
will use the -g flag to compile the code.

(gdb)
</pre>

Above the (gdb) prompt you will notice some text.  It is here that you
will see any errors that were encountered when trying to load your
binary.  <p>

</p><h3>Basic Commands</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>run</b></dt>
  <dd>Starts the program.  If you do not set up any breakpoints
      the program will run until it terminates or core dumps
      :)</dd> 
  <dt><b>print -var-</b></dt>
  <dd>This command prints a variable located in the current
      scope.  For example  
      <pre>print i</pre>
      or if a is an array
      <pre>print a[3]</pre>  Also you can print variables of
      variables, again if a is an array and i is an integer, 
      <pre>print a[i]</pre>
      Finally you can shorten this up, by saying
      <pre>p a[3]</pre> 
      'p' is just shorthand of print.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>next</b></dt>
  <dd>This executes the current command, and moves to the next command
      in the program, this too can be made in shorthand by 'n'
  </dd>
  <dt><b>step</b></dt>
  <dd>This steps through the next command.  There are differences
      between step and next.  If you are at a function call, and you
      hit next, then the function will exectute and return.  But if
      you hit step, then you will go to the first line of that
      function.  's' is just the shorthand of step.  
  </dd><dt><b>break -number or function-</b></dt>
  <dd>This sets a break point.  Its basic functionality is to type
      break and a filename and line number.  For example lets say we
      want to stop in word.cc line fourty-three, we could do the
      following in gdb:
      <pre>(gdb) <font color="red">break word.cc:43</font>
Breakpoint 2 at 0x11044: file word.cc, line 43.
      </pre>

      Break, like all other gdb function can be shorteed to its first
      letter 'b'.  Also we can stop on a function, lets say we want to
      stop on the function 'main'.
      <pre>(gdb)<font color="red"> b main</font> 
Breakpoint 3 at 0x110bc: file hello.cc, line 40.</pre>

      Finally conditional break points can be set up.  Lets say you
      have a for loop and you want to see what the value of x is when
      the index reaches 8001, there is no way you will step through
      this, so what you want to do is set a conditional breakpoint.
      Conditionals work just like what we talked about previously, but
      add some extra at the end. 

      <pre>(gdb) <font color="red">b word.cc:64 if isset==1</font>
Breakpoint 4 at 0x1100c: file word.cc, line 64.
      </pre>
  </dd><dd>
  </dd><dt><b>continue</b></dt>
  <dd>Once a breakpoint is hit, and you want to continue to the next
      breakpoint or simply go to the exiting state of the program, you
      can use this command.  The shorthand of this, in case you didn't
      catch the trend, is 'c'</dd> 
  <dt><b>where</b></dt>
  <dd>This command is analogous to the backtrace command, and it shows
      you were in the stack you currnetly are.  For example
      <pre> (gdb) <font color="red">run</font>
Starting program: /home/bhumphre/classwork/ta/tutorial/hello

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xff2b6dec in strlen () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1

#1  0xff2ffe18 in _doprnt () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1
#2  0xff3019d0 in printf () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1  <font color="green">&lt;--This is the function that was in my code</font>
#3  0x11064 in word::printword (this=0xffbef8b0) at word.cc:21 <font color="green">&lt;-- this is the line that it core dumped at</font>
#4  0x11110 in main () at hello.cc:14   <font color="green">&lt;-- this is the line where we called printword</font>
</pre>

</dd></dl>

In the example code, it is some simple code that just includes one
class.  The following set is a transcript of my debugging of this
code.  Please check this out for yourself.
